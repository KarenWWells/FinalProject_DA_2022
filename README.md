CanCode Communities:  Python for Data Analysis

This project is the culmination of a 12 week Python course which met for a total of 72 hours. 
The last computer programming course I took was in 1980 - Fortran - and I had no idea what I was doing.  
I learned many Python computing skills and I learned I need a whole lot more practice!!!  
This code is very rudimentary - but my skills will grow! 

I chose to analysis data which I found in The Pudding (https://pudding.cool/)).  
The article, “Someone Clever Once said Women Were Not Allowed Pockets” by Jan Diehm and Amber Thomas (https://pudding.cool/2018/08/pockets/) 
compared the pocket dimensions of 40 pairs of men’s jeans and 40 pairs of women’s jeans using creative animated displays.

I chose to utilize traditional data displays which I learned how to create in this course to share with 
students in my Introduction to Data Science course.  

I hope to ignite a spark of interest in data science with my students by sharing traditional analysis techniques 
which can lead to amazing, creative, displays.
